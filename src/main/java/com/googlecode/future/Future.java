 * method.  When a result is available it may be obtained by using the {@link #result()} method.  If 
 * result() is called and no results are available then an {@link IncompleteResultException} should be
 * thrown.  If the operation threw an exception then an {@link ExecutionException} should be thrown
 * with the underlying cause.
